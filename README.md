This app uses a local deployment of Ollama and the model Aya to translate text in images. You provide an image and it translates the text and then generates a new version of the image with the translation overlayed.

Of particular interest, 100% of the Python code was created by GenAI. I did many (many) prompts and prompt refinements, but did not manually enter a single character of Python code.
